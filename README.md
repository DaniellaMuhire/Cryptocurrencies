# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies in order to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for investment purpose. For this matter, we use unsupervised machine learning.

With the dataset, we use the following procedure:
- Preprocessing the Data for Principal Components Analysis(PCA)
- Reducing Data Dimensions using Principal Components Analysis(PCA)

And we continue by clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means and visualizing Cyrptocurrencies Results.
